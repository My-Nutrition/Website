+edit the week-display.tsx so that it displays the from and to date set in the date picker

# 2024-09-14 01:21:50.626618
+I have a React project using react-day-picker for date selection, and I'm trying to highlight a 7-day range starting from the date the user selects. The DayPicker component should display a 7-day range when a user clicks a date, and this range should be highlighted in the calendar.
+
+However, the range is not being highlighted properly.
+
+Heres the current setup:
+
+The Calendar component wraps the DayPicker and manages the rendering.
+I'm using the onSelect function to handle date selection, which should create a range of 7 days starting from the selected date.
+The CSS classes for highlighting, like day-selected and day-range-middle, are in place but not functioning as expected.

# 2024-09-14 01:24:32.841400
+switch the calendar to range mode

# 2024-09-15 00:42:08.686894

+modify the date-picker so that the week is automatically picked when a day is picked similar to this import React, { useState } from "react";

+
+/** Select the whole week when the day is clicked. */
